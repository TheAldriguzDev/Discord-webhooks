# Discord-webhooks

### In this repo you will find a simple discord webhook logger written in nodejs using axios and chalk.

To use this code i suggest you to **import** the Discord.js or the Queue.js module and use them when you actually need them.
Make sure to **do not import** both. Just choose one.

### Test files
I've also added "test.js" and "test_queue.js" files to let you understand how to use the modules. 

### Why do you need this?
You can need those modules to handle ratelimits and retry your request using only Discord.js or to prevent ratelimits and handle them using the Queue.js module

Please leave a star if this modules helped you, or if you find this interesting <3

Enjoy :)
