# Discord-webhooks
Simple discord webhook logger written in nodejs with axios and chalk

To use this code i suggest you to import as a library and use it when you actually need it.

In test.js file you can find an example on how to use it.

You can also use the queue system if you need, this has been made to help a bit in terms of discord ratelimits, it's not the best solution but it helps a lot.

If you like and if you find this useful, please leave a star <3

Enjoy :)
