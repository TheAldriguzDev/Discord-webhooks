# Discord-webhooks
Simple discord webhook logger written in nodejs with axios and chalk

To use this code i suggest you to import as a library and use it when you actually need it.

In test.js file you can find an example on how to use it.

I will load next a simple "Queue system" to avoid being ratelimited while sending webhooks 

Enjoy :)
